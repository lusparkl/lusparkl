I’m **lusparkl**, a Python dev based in Ukraine. I like building something that's hella cool and may be useful, AI agents is my new love.

**These days I’m focused on:**
- Langchain, Machine Learning and Electronics
- Learning German(that's hard though)
- Build and learn as much as I can before uni.

**Some stuff I built:**
- [Jarvis](https://github.com/lusparkl/local_ai_assistant_jarvis) -  My pride. Fully local AI assistant that can talk with you and help with lots of tasks. Still working on it btw
- [air-fryer-recipe-hub](https://github.com/lusparkl/air-fryer-recipe-hub) - Web scraper that scrapes only recipies for air fryer, cleans them up and saves to the db.
- [ballances-checker-bot](https://github.com/lusparkl/ballances-checker-bot) - Telegram bot that helps you to control all your crypto assets. Made when was pasionate about tg bots stuff, simple tho.

There is lot's of private repos that don't really look like smth I can show you. But I'll work on something new soon!
