I’m **lusparkl**, a Python dev based in Ukraine. I like building something that's hella cool and may be useful, AI agents is my new love.

**These days I’m focused on:**
- Langchain, Machine Learning and Electronics
- Learning German(that's hard though)
- Build and learn as much as I can before uni.

**Some stuff I built:**
- [Jarvis](https://github.com/lusparkl/local_ai_assistant_jarvis) -  My pride. Fully local AI assistant that can talk with you and help with lots of tasks.
- [air-fryer-recipe-hub](https://github.com/lusparkl/air-fryer-recipe-hub) - Web scraper that scrapes only recipies for air fryer, cleans them up and saves to the db.
- [my-corner](https://github.com/lusparkl/my-corner) - My personal website. Made for fun.
- [ballances-checker-bot](https://github.com/lusparkl/ballances-checker-bot) - Telegram bot that helps you to control all your crypto assets. Made when was pasionate about tg bots stuff, simple tho.
